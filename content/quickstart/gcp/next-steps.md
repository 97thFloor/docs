We've seen how to quickly get started using Google Cloud with Pulumi.

From here, you can dive deeper with additional Google Cloud tutorials:

* [Virtual Machine]({{< relref "tutorial-gce-webserver.md" >}}): Create a Debian virtual machine web server instance

In addition to the tutorial, several interesting examples are available complete with instructions:

* [Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/gcp-ts-functions): Create a serverless function
* [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/gcp-ts-gke): Create a GKE cluster and deploy an NGINX pod into it
* [Ruby on Rails on GKE and Google Cloud SQL](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/gcp-ts-k8s-ruby-on-rails-postgresql): Containerized Ruby on Rails app using Google Cloud SQL PostgresSQL, GKE and Docker Hub.
