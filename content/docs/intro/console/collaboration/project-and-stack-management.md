The Pulumi Console allows you to manage your projects and stacks. In your browser, navigate to [app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com). Once signed in, you can:

* Create new projects and get detailed instructions for deploying your stack via the [Pulumi CLI]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli" >}})
* View stack outputs and configurations
* Review your stack activity, resources, and settings

The Pulumi service backend provides safe locking so that your resource state can never
get corrupted by a concurrent update.

Navigate to previous stack updates, and see who applied what change and when. Or see the point-in-time history if an individual cloud resource.
