Next Thursday (January 17), we'll be presenting at the SF Kubernetes
meetup, alongside Pulumi's friends at
[Gravitational](https://gravitational.com/)!


We'll be giving a live-demo-driven talk showcasing our favorite
examples of how the [Pulumi SDK](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) helps
to make Kubernetes application updates reliable, reproducible, and
understandable.


In this talk we'll show some of our favorite examples of how Kubernetes
applications can benefit from Pulumi's unified infrastructure-as-code
model for cloud resources --- allowing us, for example, to declare a
managed database (*e.g.*, [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/),
[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), or [Cosmos
DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/)), and
populate a Kubernetes `Secret` with the connection string that results
when it's fully initialized.

Â 

Oh, and if you'd like an exclusive Pulumi beanie to help you through
the winter months, I'll definitely be able to help with that. If you
are afraid of receiving free clothes, you might want to skip this talk.
