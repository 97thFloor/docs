Heading to AWS re:Invent? Concerned about how you'll manage to get
[that much YAML](https://www.pulumi.com/cloudformation) into your carry
on bag? Or maybe you just like purple.

Whatever the reason, the Pulumi team will be there all week at **Booth
316, Startup Central, Aria Quad, **and we'd love to chat with you about
[AWS and Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/aws).

Catch up with us on [serverless](https://www.pulumi.com/serverless)
functions, [containers](https://www.pulumi.com/containers) and
[Kubernetes](https://www.pulumi.com/kubernetes), managed services and
any other cloud native infrastructure as code, and see how you can more
productively manage your AWS cloud resources with general purpose
programming languages. We can even help you [migrate your CloudFormation
to Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/cloudformation). 

If you want to grab a specific time to talk through your needs, [then
use this
link](https://info.pulumi.com/meetings/team-pulumi/aws-reinvent-catchup),
otherwise we'll just see you at the booth.
