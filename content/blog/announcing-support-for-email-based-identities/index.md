description: "Announcing Support for Email-based Identities"
---

[We have been hard at work the past few months providing our users with
more ways to connect to Pulumi. Here are some our past announcements
related to identities:

- [Support for Atlassian
identity](../../../com/pulumi/blog/pulumi-now-supports-atlassian-identity.html)
- [Connecting multiple identities to an existing Pulumi
account](../../../com/pulumi/blog/connecting-multiple-identities-to-pulumi.html)
- [Support for GitLab
identity](../../../com/pulumi/blog/welcoming-gitlab-users-to-pulumi.html)

**Today**, we are pleased to announce that we are launching support for
email-based identities. You no longer *need* to use a social identity to
sign-up for an account on Pulumi. Just fill out
the [signup](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/email) form, and you are
ready to go.
