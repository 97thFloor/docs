**This post is part 2 in a series on the Kubernetes API. [Part
1](../../../com/pulumi/blog/kubespy-and-the-lifecycle-of-a-kubernetes-pod-in-four-images.html)
focused on the lifecycle of a `Pod`.**

*Why isn't my `Pod` getting any traffic?*

An experienced ops team running on GKE might assemble the following
checklist to help answer this question:

1.  Does a `Service` exist? Does that service have a `.spec.selector`
    that matches some number of `Pod`s?
2.  Are the `Pod`s alive and has their readiness probe passed?
3.  Did the `Service` create an `Endpoints` object that specifies one or
    more `Pod`s to direct traffic to?
4.  Is the `Service` reachable via DNS? When you `kubectl ``exec` into a
    `Pod` and you use `curl` to poke the `Service` hostname, do you get
    a response? (If not, does *any* `Service` have a DNS entry?)
5.  Is the `Service` reachable via IP? When you SSH into a `Node` and
    you use `curl` to poke the `Service` IP, do you get a response?
6.  Is `kube-proxy` up? Is it writing iptables rules? Is it proxying to
    the `Service`?

This question might have the highest complexity-to-sentence-length ratio
of any question in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Unfortunately, it's also a
question that *every* user finds themselves asking at some point. And
when they do, it usually means their app is down.

To help answer questions like this, we've been developing a small
diagnostic tool, `kubespy`. In this post we'll look at the new
`kubespy trace` command, which is broadly aimed at automating questions
1, 2, 3, and providing "hints" about 4 and 5.

Below is a gif demonstrating the CLI experience. You can watch in
real-time as the `Service` comes online, finds pods to target, and
finally is allocated a public IP address:

What is kubespy, again?
-----------------------

`kubespy` is a simple, standalone diagnostic tool, meant to make it easy
to introspect on Kubernetes resources in real time.

Before we begin, it's worth noting that this `kubespy` actually
re-packages the machinery we developed for Kubernetes support in
[Pulumi](https://pulumi.io).

One of our major goals in this work was to make deploying an application
to Kubernetes as simple as possible, by presenting a concise summary of
this information in the CLI experience. See [my
tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/hausdorff_space/status/1039940379301179392)
on the subject, or [try it out](https://www.pulumi.com/kubernetes/) for
yourself!

A real-time view of a Service's life
-------------------------------------

The [`kubespy` repository](https://github.com/pulumi/kubespy) contains
the [simple `trace`
example](https://github.com/pulumi/kubespy/tree/master/examples/trivial-service-trace-example)
we use in this demo. The
[README](https://github.com/pulumi/kubespy/tree/master/examples/trivial-service-trace-example)
contains detailed installation instructions, as well as explaining how
to run the app (using either `kubetl` or `pulumi` though of course we
hope you will try Pulumi).

Essentially: running `kubespy trace service nginx` will cause `kubespy`
to sit and wait for you to deploy a `Service` called `nginx`. When you
run this example, it will do just this: creating a `Deployment` which
replicates an nginx `Pod` 3 times and exposes it publicly to the
Internet with a `Service`, also called `nginx`.

Let's break down the `kubespy trace` gif above to show that there are
actually several distinct steps in the process of booting up a
`Service`.

**First: `Service` is created, the `Service` controller creates an
`Endpoints` object of the same name.** The `Endpoints` object is to
specify which `Pod`s get traffic --- their IPs, which ports to direct
traffic to, and so on. In this case, there are no `Pod`s to target,
which `kubespy trace` tells us:

![1-trace-success-create-svc](https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=600&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif){width="600"
sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"
srcset="https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=300&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 300w, https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=600&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 600w, https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=900&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 900w, https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=1200&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 1200w, https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=1500&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 1500w, https://blog.pulumi.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/kubespy/1-trace-success-create-svc.gif?width=1800&name=1-trace-success-create-svc.gif 1800w"}

**Second: `Pod`s that match the `Service`'s `.spec.selector` are
created; their readiness probes immediately pass.** The `Endpoints`
object is updated to reflect this. As we will see below, if the `Pods`
failed the readiness probes, `kubespy trace` would note this.Â

**Third: `Service` is allocated a public IP address.** The `Service` has
`.spec.type` set to `LoadBalancer`, which on most cloud platforms means
that a public IP address should be allocated for it.

Exercise: Other Service types, watching rollouts, deleting Services!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

`kubespy trace` supports all the other `Service` types, including
`ExternalName` and `ClusterIP`. Try both of those, and you'll see
slightly different output. Try them! It's also worth watching what
happens when a `Service` is deleted.

You can also use `kubespy trace` to watch an unhealthy deployment become
healthy. In the following gif, we see a bunch of `Pod`s that are failing
readiness checks become healthy as a new version is rolled out:

Conclusions
-----------

Confession time. Last time we told you we'd dig more into the lifecycle
of a `Pod`. And we will, at some point. But we ended up deciding that it
would be easier to explain with a cohesive `trace` command.

And, while this is a good start, it is only the beginning. `trace`
currently supports only `Service`. In our next post, we'll extend trace
to `Deployment` (or perhaps `ReplicaSet`), and from there, we will have
enough tools to really dig into what is happening when you roll out your
app.

**In the mean time, if you enjoyed this post, or are curious to see how
this lifecycle is baked into the Pulumi CLI, please [give us a
shot](https://www.pulumi.com/kubernetes/)! We'd love to have your
feedback.**
